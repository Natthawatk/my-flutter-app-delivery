# Setup Instructions for New Repository

## Steps to Create New Repository

1. **Create new repository on GitHub**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `my-delivery-app-flutter` (or your preferred name)
   - Description: "Flutter mobile app for delivery service"
   - Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Remove old git history and push to new repo**

```bash
cd my-flutter-app

# Remove old git connection
rm -rf .git

# Initialize new git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Flutter delivery app with GitHub Actions"

# Add new remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/my-delivery-app-flutter.git

# Push to new repository
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

3. **Verify GitHub Actions**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click "Actions" tab
   - You should see "Build Flutter APK" workflow running
   - Wait for it to complete (5-10 minutes)

4. **Download APK**
   - After workflow completes successfully
   - Click on the workflow run
   - Scroll down to "Artifacts"
   - Download "app-release"
   - Extract the zip file to get `app-release.apk`

## What's Included

✅ Complete Flutter app source code
✅ GitHub Actions workflow for automated APK building
✅ README.md with documentation
✅ .gitignore configured properly
✅ Production API endpoint configured

## Troubleshooting

### If build fails:
1. Check Actions tab for error logs
2. Common issues:
   - Dart SDK version mismatch (already fixed in workflow)
   - Missing dependencies (workflow handles this)
   - Build configuration errors (check build.gradle files)

### If you need to update Flutter version:
Edit `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`:
```yaml
flutter-version: '3.27.1'  # Change this version
```

## Next Steps

After successful setup:
1. Test the APK on Android device
2. Configure app signing for Play Store (if needed)
3. Update app version in `pubspec.yaml`
4. Create releases with tags: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0`
